# PlutoPaperSoccer.jl
First programming project at the Royal Military Academy (Belgium)

Each student had to select a game from a provided list and create it using _Pluto.jl_

There are two versions of the game: 
- The multiplayer version called "_PaperSoccer.jl_"
- The player vs. Bot version called "_PaperSoccer_Bot.jl_"
